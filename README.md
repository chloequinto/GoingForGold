# GoingForGold


## About
GoingForGold is developing a consumer mobile application in order to help train tennis athletes. This app will be able to analyze videos taken by the user of their tennis serve. Using machine learning and computer vision, the users video will be slowed down and compared to a folder of tennis serves, performed by professional players. The app will then generate feedback to the user on their form and technique.

## Video Classifer Model 
There are a few required dependencies you will need before being able run and train the model: 
```
pip3 install pandas
pip3 install keras
pip3 install scikit-image
pip3 install tqdm
```
